# Data-Analytics-Project
Hello, fellow data enthusiasts! In this session, I've worked on a project analyzing data from a fictional rental bike company called Bicyclist. 
I used Python for the analysis, covering important aspects such as data cleaning, data preparation, and data visualization. Please feel free to share your thoughts and provide any comments you may have!"
